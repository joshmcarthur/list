      Create visual wonders with lists of images and graphics, or keep things basic with a simple text list. Making lists has never been easier, or more flexible.

          %li A list of design resources
          %li A list of places to visit

      Keep lists to yourself if you want, or share with friends. You can even make an idea public, and see contributions from all over the world. Public lists also have the bonus of being allowed to 'feature' on the site, just like the lists you see on this page.

      You can use your own set of colors and background images to make your lists your own. If you've logged in with Twitter, you can even use the same settings as your Twitter page!

    List isn't just any old to-do list. Why limit it to to-do? 
  %p
    Create anything that might appear in any sort of order, and then
    use it however you want - keep it to yourself, or share it with friends.
  %p
    Make it public, and watch people from all over the world contribute.
    Mix things up to list almost any kind of information, and make your list look just the way you want it.
